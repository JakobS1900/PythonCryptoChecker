# üìù Changelog

All notable changes to the CryptoChecker Gaming Platform are documented in this file.

## [2.2.1] - 2025-10-04 - "Roulette Animation Visibility Fix"

### üéÆ Gaming Fixes

#### Roulette Wheel Animation
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Roulette wheel animation now stays visible during entire spin
- **PROBLEM RESOLVED**: Wheel was flying thousands of pixels off-screen, making animation invisible
- **SOLUTION**: Simplified animation logic to keep wheel centered and visible
  - Removed large negative offset calculations (`finalPosition - 1500`)
  - Implemented visible rotation cycles (3 full wheel rotations)
  - Calculated final position relative to container center
  - Added smooth deceleration with cubic-bezier easing
- **FILE MODIFIED**: `web/static/js/roulette.js` - `animateWheel()` function (lines 2004-2026)
- **USER EXPERIENCE**: Players now see smooth casino-style roll revealing winning number

### üé® Visual Improvements
- **Smooth Roll Effect**: 3 visible cycles through all 37 numbers before landing
- **Professional Animation**: Realistic deceleration matching casino roulette behavior
- **Centered Display**: Wheel remains properly centered throughout animation
- **Winning Number Reveal**: Natural slow-down reveals winner instead of instant pop-up

## [2.2.0] - 2025-09-11 - "Trading Restored, GEM Economy, Roulette Cleanup"

### üíπ Trading & GEM Economy
- Restored Trading interface at `/trading` with portfolio, holdings, orders, transactions.
- Quick Trade uses real-time crypto prices; USD amount converts to coin quantity based on live price.
- GEM wallet integration: Buy/Sell adjusts GEM using configurable conversion rate.
- New env `GEM_USD_RATE_USD_PER_GEM` (default 0.01 ‚áí 1 GEM = $0.01 ‚áí 1000 GEM = $10).
- Fixed router inclusion so endpoints are correctly exposed under `/api/trading/...`.

### üé∞ Roulette UI Cleanup
- Removed conflicting script include; classic bets only (number, color, even/odd, high/low).
- Added clean layout overrides for wheel/pointer/number overlay; Spin enables after placing bets.

### üîê Authentication & UX
- Eliminated invisible/logout misfires by limiting logout handler to explicit controls.
- `/api/auth/login` accepts `username_or_email` and returns appropriate 4xx/5xx status codes.

### üè† Stability & ORM Fixes
- Home route 500s resolved via startup constants/stubs and graceful template fallback.
- Removed cross-registry SQLAlchemy relationships to `User` in gamification models to prevent mapper errors.
