# 🤖 CryptoChecker Agents - User Guide

## 📋 What Are Agents in Claude Code?

Agents in Claude Code are specialized AI assistants that can be launched to handle specific types of tasks autonomously. Think of them as expert team members who understand your project and can work independently on complex, multi-step tasks.

### **Traditional Claude Code vs Agents**
- **Regular Claude**: You interact directly, giving step-by-step instructions
- **Agents**: You describe the goal, Claude launches a specialist who works autonomously and reports back

## 🎯 Your CryptoChecker Agents Team

You now have **4 specialized agents** designed specifically for your CryptoChecker Gaming Platform:

### **1. Testing & QA Agent** (`crypto-tester`)
- **What it does**: Runs comprehensive tests while being smart about your project
- **Best for**: Test validation, quality assurance, test suite maintenance
- **Smart features**: Reads your docs first, won't delete important test files

### **2. Deep Research Debugging Agent** (`crypto-deep-debugger`)
- **What it does**: Solves complex bugs using advanced research tools
- **Best for**: Production issues, mysterious bugs, system failures
- **Smart features**: Uses expensive tools only when needed, escalates appropriately

### **3. Construction & Overhaul Agent** (`crypto-constructor`)
- **What it does**: Builds new features or major system changes using zen tools
- **Best for**: New features, major refactoring, system architecture changes
- **Smart features**: Full workflow orchestration, professional code review process

### **4. Context & Documentation Agent** (`crypto-context-keeper`)
- **What it does**: Manages project knowledge and keeps documentation current
- **Best for**: Documentation updates, project status, knowledge management
- **Smart features**: Knows all your .md files, enforces CLAUDE.md guidelines

## 🚀 How to Use Agents - Step by Step

### **Method 1: Quick Launch (Recommended for Beginners)**

Just tell Claude what you want to accomplish, and mention you want to use agents:

```
"I need to run comprehensive tests on the crypto roulette system. Please use the appropriate agent for this."
```

Claude will automatically:
1. Analyze your request
2. Select the best agent (Testing Agent in this case)
3. Launch the agent with proper context
4. Show you the results when complete

### **Method 2: Specific Agent Request**

If you know which agent you want:

```
"Please launch the crypto-tester agent to validate all betting functionality and clean up any temporary test files."
```

### **Method 3: Complex Multi-Agent Workflows**

For bigger projects, you can request multiple agents:

```
"I want to implement a new dice game feature. Please use the constructor agent to plan and build it, then the tester agent to validate it works correctly."
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Effective Agent Use

### **Be Specific About Goals**
❌ **Vague**: "Fix the roulette thing"
✅ **Clear**: "Fix the issue where custom bet amounts over 1000 GEM are not being preserved correctly"

### **Mention Context When Relevant**
✅ **Good**: "I just updated the database schema, please run tests to make sure everything still works"
✅ **Better**: "After my database changes for user sessions, please test authentication flows and balance synchronization"

### **Indicate Urgency/Complexity**
- **"This is critical"** → Uses more powerful (expensive) tools
- **"This is a simple fix"** → Uses cost-effective approach
- **"This is complex"** → Uses full workflow with multiple validation steps

### **Trust the Process**
- Agents work autonomously - you don't need to micromanage
- They'll read your documentation and understand your project context
- They'll report back with comprehensive results and recommendations
