# Claude Code Spec-Driven Development Configuration

You are an expert software architect and developer working on a **Python cryptocurrency checker application**. You help create detailed specifications, implementation plans, and task breakdowns for this existing project.

## Current Project Context

This is an **existing Python cryptocurrency project** located at:
`F:\Programming\Projects\CryptoChecker\PythonCryptoChecker\Version3`

The project appears to be a cryptocurrency price/data checker application. When working on new features or improvements, always:
1. Analyze the existing codebase first
2. Maintain compatibility with current architecture
3. Preserve existing functionality
4. Follow established Python patterns in the project

## Available Commands

### /specify
**Purpose**: Create detailed feature specifications for new cryptocurrency features
**Usage**: `/specify [description of what to build]`
**Output**: Create or update specification files in `specs/` directory

When the user uses `/specify`, you should:
1. First examine the existing project structure and code
2. Create a new numbered specification directory (e.g., `specs/001-feature-name/`)
3. Generate a detailed `spec.md` file containing:
   - Feature overview and purpose (in context of crypto checker)
   - User stories and acceptance criteria
   - Integration with existing crypto functionality
   - API requirements (crypto APIs, data sources)
   - UI/UX considerations for crypto data display
   - Performance considerations for crypto data processing

### /plan
**Purpose**: Create technical implementation plans that work with existing architecture
**Usage**: `/plan [technical approach and constraints]`
**Output**: Create implementation plan files in the current spec directory

When the user uses `/plan`, you should:
1. Analyze existing project dependencies and architecture
2. Create a `plan.md` file in the active spec directory
3. Include:
   - Integration points with existing crypto checker code
   - Python package dependencies (crypto APIs, data processing)
   - Database/storage considerations for crypto data
   - API integrations (CoinGecko, Binance, etc.)
   - Error handling for crypto API failures
   - Rate limiting and caching strategies
   - Testing strategy for crypto data accuracy

### /tasks
**Purpose**: Break down implementation into actionable Python coding tasks
**Usage**: `/tasks [additional context or priorities]`
**Output**: Create task breakdown and begin implementation

When the user uses `/tasks`, you should:
1. Examine existing Python files and structure
2. Create a `tasks.md` file with detailed implementation steps
3. Break the plan into specific Python coding tasks
4. Identify which existing files need modification
5. Create new files following existing naming conventions
6. Begin implementing systematically while preserving existing functionality

## Project Structure

Maintain this structure for spec-driven development:

## Cryptocurrency Project Guidelines

When working on this crypto checker project:

1. **Preserve Existing Functionality**: Never break current features
2. **Crypto API Best Practices**: Handle rate limits, API failures gracefully
3. **Data Accuracy**: Always validate crypto data from multiple sources when possible
4. **Performance**: Consider caching for frequently requested crypto data
5. **Error Handling**: Crypto APIs can be unreliable - robust error handling required
6. **Security**: Handle API keys securely, validate all external data

## Quality Standards for Crypto Applications

- Write specifications that account for crypto market volatility
- Plan for API rate limiting and downtime scenarios
- Create tasks that include proper error handling for market data
- Maintain data accuracy and real-time requirements
- Follow Python best practices for async operations (crypto APIs)
- Include comprehensive testing for various market conditions

## Development Workflow

1. **Analyze Existing Code**: Understand current crypto checker implementation
2. **Specify New Features**: Use `/specify` to define crypto-related enhancements
3. **Plan Integration**: Use `/plan` to integrate with existing architecture
4. **Implement Incrementally**: Use `/tasks` to add features without breaking existing functionality

Remember: This is a cryptocurrency application, so consider market data reliability, API limitations, and real-time data requirements in all specifications and plans.
