     __version__ = "2.0.0"
     __all__ = ["main"]

‚óè Completed the comprehensive REST API endpoints! I've successfully created:       

  Social API (social_api.py) - 434 lines covering:
  - Friend management (requests, accept/decline, removal)
  - Leaderboards with multiple ranking types
  - Gifting system between friends
  - Activity feeds and social stats
  - User status and online presence

  Admin API (admin_api.py) - 542 lines covering:
  - User management (ban, suspend, promote, demote)
  - Bulk currency adjustments
  - Custom item and achievement creation
  - System statistics and overview
  - Maintenance scheduling
  - System logs access

  Key Features Implemented:

  1. Security: Role-based access control with admin/moderator permissions
  2. Comprehensive Management: Full CRUD operations for users, items,
  achievements
  3. Social Features: Complete friend system with privacy controls
  4. System Monitoring: Admin dashboard capabilities with statistics
  5. Pydantic v2 Compatibility: Fixed all regex parameters to pattern

  The REST API layer is now complete with all major endpoints:
  - Authentication (auth_api.py) ‚úÖ
  - Gaming (gaming_api.py) ‚úÖ
  - Inventory (inventory_api.py) ‚úÖ
  - Social (social_api.py) ‚úÖ
  - Admin (admin_api.py) ‚úÖ
